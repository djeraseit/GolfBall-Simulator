# GolfBall-Simulator
This Simulator Maps the Flight of a golf ball using a graph 
The simulator will also give stats relating to the shot such as its carry distance
## Inputs: 
Using Tracker (Software) or another physics motion tracking engine, use a video of the ball being struck to calculate its initial position on an axis and another position after it has been hit. Calculate the time it took for the ball to move between these two points. 
- The golf club used
- The X and Y axis coordinates and the time take between those points
- The air temperature that day
